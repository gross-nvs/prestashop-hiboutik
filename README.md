# Hiboutik module for Prestashop

This repository contains the open source module that allows you to synchronize Hiboutik POS software and Prestashop.
All your online sales are automatically integrated in your Hiboutik account.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3.0 or newer
* PHP cURL extension

## Description

When a customer makes a purchase in your store, your inventory levels will be updated in your Prestashop store.

All Prestashop sales will be created in your Hiboutik account automatically in real-time, when the order status updates to "payment accepted".

When you complete a stock order, a transfer, or an inventory count in your Hiboutik account, you must push all your inventory levels in Prestashop, from the module settings page (SYNC NOW button).

When a sale comes through to Hiboutik from your Prestashop store, we'll add the shipping charge amount to the Shipping product setup on the module settings page.


## Installation

Download Zip archive

On your Prestashop admin interface : Modules > Modules Catalog > Upload a module
